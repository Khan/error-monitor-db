"""Logic for tracking error classes & occurrences in Redis.

Errors are filtered entries from AppEngine's server logs having an error level
of ERROR or CRITICAL, which are emitted either by our own code in webapp or by
exceptions thrown in any code running on AppEngine. The version we receive here
is roughly a dictionary version of the fields in AppEngine's original
RequestLog class:

    https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/python/logs/requestlogclass

Each error we receive from the logs is considered an /occurrence/ of some
more general error /class/ that we want to track the frequency of by grouping
together the occurrences while ignoring specifics such as user IP, the exact
stack trace, etc.

The `message` field is either a string we emit in `logging.error` or
`logging.critical` calls, or an Exception's message followed by the stack
trace. Thus the message is the most important component we use to group errors,
but we can't do simple comparisons because errors may have numbers names or
other variables interpolated into them, so we have to be clever about how we
derive identifiers from the message.

There are several derived identifiers that we compare errors by and any _one_
match will cause the errors to be grouped together, so occurrence A can match
occurrence B, which in turn matches occurrence C, even if A and C don't match.
This results in a grouping that is dependent on the order the occurrences are
observed, but in practice this should be rare.

An error /class/ is represented by an error definition (error_def) which
contains the following identifying information:

    key:         A hash of the status, level, and various IDs that uniquely
                 identifies the error.

    title:       The first line of the error message, which is used as a
                 human-readable identifier.

    status:      The response status of the handler that reported the error,
                 e.g. 400, 404, 500, etc.

    level:       The error level from AppEngine, always either 3 (ERROR) or 4
                 (CRITICAL).

    id0/.../id3: Various identifiers extracted from the error message. If a new
                 error instance matches any of these identifiers, we group it
                 with this class instead of creating a new class for it.

See `_parse_message` for an example error_def.

For each error class we track the following data per /occurrence/:

    ip:          The source IP address for the request.

    resource:    The request URI.

    route:       The route identifier of the handler that handled the request.

    module_id:   The GAE module that handled the request.

    stack:       A parsed version of the stack trace (if any) extracted from
                 the message, including a filename, line number, and method
                 name.

    stack_key:   A hash of the stack trace, for coalescing similar stacks.

We write to the following Redis keys:

    // Error definition (static for each error class)

    error:<key> - JSONified error_def for the error class identified by 'key'

    errordef:id0 ... errordef:id3 - Hashtables of identifier -> error key for
        various identifier types

    // Monitoring keys

    ver:<version>:errors - Sorted set of error keys seen on this GAE version

    ver:<version>:errors_by_minute:<minute> - Sorted set of error keys seen
        during a 60-second interval 'minute' minutes after monitoring has begun

    ver:<version>:error:<key>:ips - Sorted set of IPs associated with the error

    ver:<version>:error:<key>:stacks:msgs - Hashtable of stack key ->
        JSONified stack trace for all stacks associated with this error

    ver:<version>:error:<key>:stacks:counts - Sorted set of stack keys
        associated with the error

    ver:<version>:error:<key>:routes - Sorted set of routes associated with the
        error

    ver:<version>:error:<key>:uris - Sorted set of URIs associated with the
        error

    ver:<version>:error:<key>:modules - Sorted set of GAE modules associated
        with the error

    (NOTE: Sorted sets in Redis are maps of {string: int} ordered by value, and
    in this case the value is the incidence count.)
